    <p><strong>What is Total Knee Replacement?</strong><br>
      Total knee replacement (also called total knee arthroplasty) is a surgical procedure in which a damaged or worn-out knee joint is replaced with artificial components, usually made of metal and plastic, to restore function and relieve pain. It is commonly recommended for people with severe knee arthritis, injury, or deformity when other treatments like medication, physical therapy, or injections no longer provide relief. The surgery involves removing the damaged surfaces of the thigh bone, shin bone, and kneecap, then replacing them with prosthetic parts that mimic the natural movement of the knee, helping patients regain mobility and improve quality of life.</p>
    <p><strong>How Does Your Knee Work?</strong><br>
      Your knee works like a hinge that allows your leg to bend and straighten, while also providing stability for walking, running, and standing. It is made up of three main bones: the thigh bone (femur), the shin bone (tibia), and the kneecap (patella). These bones meet at the joint and are covered by smooth cartilage that helps them glide easily against each other. Strong ligaments act like ropes, holding the bones together and controlling movement, while muscles and tendons around the knee provide power and support. The knee also contains a cushion called the meniscus, which absorbs shock and protects the joint. All these parts work together to let you move smoothly and bear your body’s weight.</p>
    <p><strong>What is Total Knee Replacement Surgery?</strong><br>
      Total knee replacement surgery is an operation in which a damaged or diseased knee joint is removed and replaced with artificial parts, called prostheses, made of metal and plastic. The procedure is usually done when conditions like severe arthritis, injury, or deformity cause constant pain, stiffness, and difficulty moving that do not improve with other treatments. During the surgery, the surgeon removes the damaged surfaces of the thigh bone, shin bone, and sometimes the kneecap, then reshapes them to fit the artificial components. These new parts are fixed in place to create a smooth joint surface, allowing the knee to bend and straighten more comfortably. The goal of the surgery is to reduce pain, improve mobility, and help patients return to normal daily activities.</p>
    <p><strong>How is Total Knee Surgery Performed?</strong><br>
      Total knee replacement surgery is done by first giving anesthesia, then making an incision at the front of the knee to reach the joint. The surgeon removes the damaged cartilage and small portions of bone from the thigh bone (femur), shin bone (tibia), and sometimes the kneecap (patella). These surfaces are then reshaped and covered with artificial components made of metal and plastic, which are fixed in place using bone cement or special coatings. A smooth plastic spacer is inserted between the metal parts to allow the joint to move easily, and finally, the incision is closed with stitches or staples. The surgery usually takes 1–2 hours and is followed by recovery and rehabilitation to restore movement and strength.</p>
