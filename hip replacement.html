    <p><strong>What is Total Hip Replacement?</strong><br>
      Total hip replacement is a surgical procedure in which a damaged or diseased hip joint is removed and replaced with an artificial joint, usually made of metal, ceramic, or plastic components. It is commonly performed to relieve pain and improve mobility in patients with severe arthritis, hip fractures, or other hip joint conditions that do not respond to non-surgical treatments. The artificial joint (prosthesis) mimics the natural function of the hip, allowing smoother movement and helping patients return to daily activities with less pain and greater flexibility.</p>
    <p><strong>How Does Your Hip Work?</strong><br>
      Your hip works like a ball-and-socket joint, which gives it both strength and flexibility. The **ball** is the top of your thigh bone (femur), called the femoral head, and the **socket** is part of your pelvis, called the acetabulum. Both surfaces are covered with smooth cartilage that allows them to glide against each other with very little friction. A capsule of strong ligaments and muscles holds the joint together while still allowing a wide range of movement—like walking, sitting, bending, or rotating your leg. Fluid inside the joint (synovial fluid) helps lubricate and cushion it, so your hip can bear weight and move smoothly without pain.</p>
    <p><strong>What is Total Hip Replacement Surgery?</strong><br>
      Total hip replacement surgery is an operation in which a surgeon removes the damaged or worn-out parts of the hip joint and replaces them with artificial parts called prostheses. The procedure involves taking out the diseased femoral head (the ball) and resurfacing or replacing the socket in the pelvis, then inserting a new artificial ball and socket made of metal, ceramic, or durable plastic. This new joint works like a natural hip, reducing pain, restoring movement, and improving the patient’s ability to walk, sit, and perform daily activities. It is usually recommended when severe arthritis, injury, or other hip conditions no longer respond to medications, therapy, or lifestyle changes.</p>
    <p><strong>How is Total Hip Surgery Performed?</strong><br>
      Total hip replacement surgery is usually performed under spinal or general anesthesia and takes a few hours. The surgeon begins by making an incision on the side or back of the hip to access the joint. The damaged femoral head (the “ball” of the hip) is carefully removed, and the socket in the pelvis is cleaned and reshaped. An artificial socket (cup) is then placed into the pelvic bone, and a metal stem is inserted into the thigh bone. A new ball, made of metal or ceramic, is attached to the stem and fits smoothly into the new socket. Once the artificial components are securely fixed, the surgeon checks the hip’s range of motion and stability before closing the incision with stitches or staples. After surgery, patients usually begin gentle movement and physical therapy within a day or two to promote healing and restore mobility.</p>
